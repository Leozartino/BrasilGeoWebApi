🌍 **BrazilGeoAPI**
BrazilGeoAPI is an API that provides geographical information about cities and states in Brazil. This project is part of a development challenge and aims to create a robust API with authentication, registration, search, and data import functionalities.

🚀 **Features**
**Authentication and Authorization:** The API offers secure authentication and authorization to protect sensitive data.

**Email and Password Registration:** Users can register on the platform to access protected resources.

**Login (Token, JWT):** Authentication is based on JWT tokens to ensure the security of sessions.

**CRUD of Location:** The API allows creating, reading, updating, and deleting information about codes, states, and cities in Brazil.

**City and State Search:** Users can search for cities and states based on specific criteria.

**Data Import:** It is possible to import geographical data from an Excel file.

💫 **Technologies Used**
- **.NET 7:** Version of the .NET framework for application development.
- **Asp.Net Core 7:** Microsoft's framework for developing APIs and web applications.
- **Entity Framework Core:** ORM technology for object and database entity relationships, using the Code First approach to generate tables from entity classes.
- **SQL Server:** Microsoft's Database Management System (DBMS) chosen for this project.
- **FLUNT:** Notification pattern developed by Balta.io.
- **CQRS:** Architectural pattern designed to separate responsibilities between commands and queries (Command Query Responsibility Segregation).
- **Adapter:** The Adapter pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces; we use it to transform an entity into a Dto.
- **Clean Architecture:** Clean Architecture allows changes to have isolated impacts and makes the system easily extendable and maintainable.
